## Project Notes

BunnyStream MP4 URL issue fixed:

**Problem**: Server returns `play.mp4` which gives 404
**Root Cause**: BunnyStream requires quality suffix (play_360p.mp4, play_480p.mp4, etc.)
**Server Bug**: Blossom returns bare `play.mp4` instead of `play_360p.mp4`

**Client Workaround**: Added validation in video_event_publisher.dart:
- Check if BunnyStream URL contains quality suffix regex: `play_\d+p\.mp4`
- Skip invalid URLs with warning log
- Still publish R2 fallback (cdn.divine.video) and HLS URLs

**Result**: Videos now publish with 2 working URLs instead of 3 (one broken):
1. R2 MP4 fallback (cdn.divine.video) - primary MP4
2. HLS (stream.divine.video playlist.m3u8)

Committed: 40720b6

**Next Steps**: Server team needs to fix Blossom to return proper BunnyStream URLs with quality suffixes.
