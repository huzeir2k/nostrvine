## Project Notes

Bug reporting architecture planning:
- Existing: Firebase Crashlytics captures crashes automatically
- Need: User-initiated bug reports with full diagnostic data
- Options: Enhanced Firebase OR NIP-17 encrypted messages
- Best approach: Hybrid - keep Firebase for automatic crashes, add NIP-17 for user reports to align with decentralization goals
