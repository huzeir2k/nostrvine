## Project Notes

## Settings Screen Navigation Fix

**Problem**: Settings screen didn't have a way to exit - user got stuck

**Root Cause**: AppBar didn't have an explicit back button, even though we were using Navigator.push()

**Solution**: Added explicit back button to Settings AppBar
- File: `lib/screens/settings_screen.dart`
- Added `leading: IconButton(icon: Icon(Icons.arrow_back), onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pop())`
- Kept bottom navigation and camera FAB per user request
- User specifically likes the camera FAB in the bottom nav

**Key Learnings**:
- Sometimes Flutter's automatic back button doesn't appear even with Navigator.push()
- Always add explicit back buttons for modal/settings screens
- Bottom nav and camera FAB should stay on Settings screen per user preference
- Multiple bottom nav instances exist - this is intentional

## Dark Mode Documentation

**Added to CLAUDE.md**:
- UI/UX Requirements section documenting that OpenVine is **DARK MODE ONLY**
- No light mode themes
- Always use Colors.black, VineTheme.backgroundColor, VineTheme.whiteText
- Dark aesthetic is core to app identity

**Added to README**:
- Listed "Dark Mode Only" as a core feature
- Emphasized sleek dark aesthetic optimized for video viewing

**User Request**: "make it clear the app is darkmode only"

This is now documented in both developer docs (CLAUDE.md) and user-facing docs (README.md).
