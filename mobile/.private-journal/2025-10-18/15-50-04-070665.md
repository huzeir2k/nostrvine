## Project Notes

Bug report system Phase 1 completed in ~2 hours (as estimated in architecture docs).

**Files created:**
- lib/config/bug_report_config.dart (support npub configured)
- lib/models/log_entry.dart (data model)
- lib/services/log_capture_service.dart (circular buffer)
- test/unit/services/log_capture_service_test.dart (comprehensive tests)

**Files modified:**
- lib/utils/unified_logger.dart (integrated log capture)

All logs now buffered automatically for bug reports. Next: collect device info, relay status, error counts, then send via NIP-17.
