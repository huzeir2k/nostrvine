## Project Notes

## Bug Report System Architecture - COMPLETED

Successfully designed comprehensive bug report system architecture for OpenVine.

**Delivered**:
- Complete architecture document: `docs/BUG_REPORT_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- 5-phase implementation plan with TDD approach
- Data structures for LogEntry, BugReportData, BugReportResult
- NIP-17 three-layer encryption specification
- UI integration plan (Settings screen + in-app dialogs)
- Comprehensive test strategy (unit, integration, widget, golden)
- Privacy/security considerations with sensitive data sanitization

**Key Architecture Decisions**:
1. **LogCaptureService**: Circular buffer (1000 entries) integrated into UnifiedLogger
2. **BugReportService**: Orchestrates diagnostic collection from multiple services
3. **NIP17MessageService**: Handles kind 14 → kind 13 → kind 1059 encryption chain
4. **Data Flow**: UI → BugReportService → NIP17MessageService → NostrService → Relay

**Files to Create** (in phases):
- lib/models/log_entry.dart
- lib/models/bug_report_data.dart
- lib/models/bug_report_result.dart
- lib/config/bug_report_config.dart
- lib/services/log_capture_service.dart
- lib/services/bug_report_service.dart
- lib/services/nip17_message_service.dart
- lib/widgets/bug_report_dialog.dart
- lib/screens/bug_report_screen.dart (optional)
- Plus 8+ test files

**Critical Next Steps**:
1. Verify nostr_sdk has NIP-44 and NIP-59 support (check ../nostr_sdk/lib/nip44 and nip59)
2. Generate or obtain OpenVine support pubkey for bug report recipient
3. Start Phase 1: LogCaptureService TDD implementation
