## Project Notes

## Bug Reporting System - Navigation Fix & Relay Backup

**Problem**: User couldn't find bug reporting UI - no access to Settings screen from the app navigation.

**Solution**: Added Settings icon button in top-right corner of Profile screen (only on own profile)
- File: `lib/screens/profile_screen_router.dart`
- Added IconButton with settings icon that navigates to `/settings` route
- Uses `context.go('/settings')` for GoRouter navigation
- Positioned above profile header using SliverToBoxAdapter
- Conditional rendering: only shows on user's own profile (`isOwnProfile`)

**Relay Backup**: Added relay.nos.social as backup relay for bug reports
- File: `lib/services/nip17_message_service.dart` - Added public getter for nostrService
- File: `lib/services/bug_report_service.dart` - Added relay before sending bug reports
- Gracefully handles relay addition failures (logs warning, continues anyway)
- Ensures bug reports get through even if relay3.openvine.co has issues with NIP-17

**Testing**: `flutter analyze` passed with no issues on both modified files.

**User Feedback**: User pointed out critical UX issue - Settings, relays config, nsec import, etc. were inaccessible. Settings icon now provides access to:
- Bug reporting
- Relay configuration (RelaySettingsScreen)
- Media servers (BlossomSettingsScreen)
- P2P sync settings
- Notification preferences
- Profile editing
