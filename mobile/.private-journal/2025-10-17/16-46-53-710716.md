## Project Notes

Duplicate code investigation: computed_active_video_provider.dart vs active_video_provider.dart

Both define activeVideoProvider and isVideoActiveProvider, causing confusion.

Router-driven version is used by most of the app and aligns with GoRouter architecture.
Computed version is legacy pattern from pre-router days when screens manually tracked context.

Consolidation blocked by two edge cases:
1. VideoPageView epoch-based ownership for race conditions
2. video_overlay_manager modal playback (not router-managed)

Need to understand if VideoPageView is always used inside router screens or if it's used standalone.
