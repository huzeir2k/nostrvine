## Project Notes

## Editor's Picks Navigation Bug - FIXED

**Location**: `lib/providers/curation_providers.dart:30` 
**Change**: Added `@Riverpod(keepAlive: true)` annotation to `Curation` class

**Impact**: Editor's Picks now persist across navigation:
- No more "0 videos" when returning to tab
- State survives tab switches  
- Async initialization completes once

**Test**: `test/providers/curation_providers_lifecycle_test.dart` verifies lifecycle behavior

**Confirmed Working**: Rabble's QA smoke test passed
