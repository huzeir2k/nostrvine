## Project Notes

ProfileScreenRouter refactor completed:

Changed from imperative VideoPageView widget to declarative PageView.builder pattern.

Before:
- VideoPageView manually called setContext(screenId, index, videoId)
- Epoch-based ownership tracking for race conditions
- Complex lifecycle management

After:
- Direct PageView.builder like HomeScreenRouter
- URL is source of truth via pageContextProvider
- Simple controller sync on URL changes
- Active video derived reactively from router state

The pattern is now consistent across all router-aware screens. Only modals/overlays still use the manual active video pattern.
