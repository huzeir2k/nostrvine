## Project Notes

**Active Video Provider System Clarification**:

There ARE two provider files, but they serve different architectural approaches:
- **active_video_provider.dart**: Router-driven, used by VideoFeedItem, derives active state from GoRouter URL
- **computed_active_video_provider.dart**: Imperative, used by VideoPageView/video_overlay_manager, requires manual setContext() calls

The router-driven one is the PRIMARY system used throughout the app. The computed one is legacy/specialized.

For proper video playback in any new screen, MUST use GoRouter navigation so active_video_provider can derive the active video from the URL.

**Test File Created**: test/router/search_route_test.dart validates both grid and feed mode navigation

**Known Issue**: 317 analyze errors exist, mostly related to tests importing wrong active video provider. This is technical debt to be addressed separately - doesn't affect runtime.
