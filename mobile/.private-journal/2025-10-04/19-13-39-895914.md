## Project Notes

**OpenVine Provider Architecture Gotcha**

The `socialProvider` must use `keepAlive: true` because:
1. It loads following list asynchronously on startup
2. Other providers (homeFeedProvider) depend on it but only use `ref.read()` (not `ref.watch()`)
3. If it auto-disposes during initialization, the following list never loads
4. This causes home feed to show empty state incorrectly
