# Deep Link Server Setup for divine.video

To enable iOS universal links and Android app links, you need to host two verification files on the divine.video server.

## Files to Create

### 1. iOS Universal Links Verification

**File**: `apple-app-site-association` (no file extension)
**Location**: `https://divine.video/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`
**Alternative Location**: `https://divine.video/apple-app-site-association`

```json
{
  "applinks": {
    "apps": [],
    "details": [
      {
        "appID": "TEAM_ID.co.openvine.app",
        "paths": [
          "/video/*",
          "/profile/*"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**How to get your TEAM_ID**:
1. Go to https://developer.apple.com/account
2. Click on "Membership" in the sidebar
3. Your Team ID is shown under "Team ID"
4. Replace `TEAM_ID` in the file above with your actual Team ID

**Important**:
- The file must be served with `Content-Type: application/json` or `application/pkcs7-mime`
- No `.json` extension in the filename
- Must be accessible via HTTPS
- Should return HTTP 200 status

### 2. Android App Links Verification

**File**: `assetlinks.json`
**Location**: `https://divine.video/.well-known/assetlinks.json`

```json
[
  {
    "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"],
    "target": {
      "namespace": "android_app",
      "package_name": "co.openvine.app",
      "sha256_cert_fingerprints": [
        "YOUR_SHA256_FINGERPRINT_HERE"
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

**How to get your SHA-256 fingerprint**:

For your release keystore:
```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore /path/to/your/release.keystore -alias your-key-alias
```

For debug builds (testing only):
```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
```

Look for the "SHA256:" line in the output and copy the fingerprint (with colons).

Example output:
```
SHA256: AB:CD:EF:12:34:56:78:90:AB:CD:EF:12:34:56:78:90:AB:CD:EF:12:34:56:78:90:AB:CD:EF:12:34:56:78:90
```

**Important**:
- The file must be served with `Content-Type: application/json`
- Must be accessible via HTTPS
- Should return HTTP 200 status
- You need a separate fingerprint for each signing key (debug, release, etc.)

## Server Configuration

### .well-known Directory

Both files should be placed in the `.well-known` directory:
```
https://divine.video/.well-known/
├── apple-app-site-association
└── assetlinks.json
```

### CORS Headers (if needed)

If you're hosting these files on a different domain or CDN, ensure CORS headers allow access:
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

### Nginx Configuration Example

```nginx
location /.well-known/apple-app-site-association {
    default_type application/json;
    add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin *;
}

location /.well-known/assetlinks.json {
    default_type application/json;
    add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin *;
}
```

## Testing

### iOS Universal Links

1. Build and install the app on a physical device (simulator won't work for universal links)
2. Send yourself an email or message with the link: `https://divine.video/video/abc123`
3. Long-press the link - you should see "Open in divine" option
4. Or simply tap the link and it should open in the app

**Verification Tool**:
- Apple provides a validator: https://search.developer.apple.com/appsearch-validation-tool/
- Enter your domain: `divine.video`

### Android App Links

1. Build and install the app on a device
2. Test the link in a browser or messaging app: `https://divine.video/video/abc123`
3. The link should automatically open in the app (no disambiguation dialog)

**Verification Command**:
```bash
adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "https://divine.video/video/test123"
```

**Check verification status**:
```bash
adb shell pm get-app-links co.openvine.app
```

Should show:
```
co.openvine.app:
  ...
  divine.video: verified
```

## Troubleshooting

### iOS Issues

- **Links open in Safari instead of app**:
  - Verify the `apple-app-site-association` file is accessible
  - Check that Team ID matches your Apple Developer account
  - Reinstall the app (iOS caches the association file)

- **"Open in app" banner doesn't appear**:
  - Make sure you're testing on a physical device
  - Check that the app is installed and the bundle ID matches

### Android Issues

- **Links open in browser instead of app**:
  - Verify `assetlinks.json` is accessible
  - Check that SHA-256 fingerprint matches your signing certificate
  - Run: `adb shell pm verify-app-links --re-verify co.openvine.app`

- **Verification fails**:
  - Ensure the JSON file is valid
  - Check that the package name is correct
  - Verify HTTPS is working (Android won't verify over HTTP)

## Example Files

See `apple-app-site-association.template` and `assetlinks.json.template` in this directory for complete examples.
