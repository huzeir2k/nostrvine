## Project Notes

OpenVine iOS Build and Provisioning Profile Issues

Current problems:
1. Build script created archive (verified it exists at Runner-2025-10-18-174335.xcarchive)
2. But Xcode Organizer shows old archive from yesterday (build 35)
3. Export to IPA fails with:
   - "Provisioning profile doesn't support Associated Domains capability"
   - "Provisioning profile doesn't include com.apple.developer.associated-domains entitlement"

Root causes:
- Provisioning profile in Apple Developer Portal needs Associated Domains capability enabled
- The entitlements file HAS the correct config (`applinks:divine.video`)
- But the provisioning profile doesn't match the entitlements
- This is an Apple Developer Portal configuration issue, not a code issue

Files involved:
- mobile/ios/Runner/Runner.entitlements - correctly configured
- mobile/build_ios.sh - build script that should increment version
- mobile/increment_build_number.sh - version increment logic
- Provisioning profile on Apple Developer Portal - MISSING capability
