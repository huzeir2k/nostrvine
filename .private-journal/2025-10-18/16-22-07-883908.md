## Project Notes

## Test Exclusions Strategy

Need to create test exclusion patterns for:
- `test/old_files/**` - Manual and deprecated tests
- Integration tests that require real platform plugins - these should either be mocked or run only on real devices

The test suite has a mix of:
- Unit tests (should use mocks, run in VM)
- Integration tests (some work in VM with mocks, some need real devices)
