## Project Notes

OpenVine iOS Build - Final Resolution

Successfully built and exported iOS app to IPA after fixing provisioning profile issues.

**Problem Summary**:
- Associated Domains capability was enabled in App ID
- Entitlements file correctly specified applinks:divine.video
- But export failed with "Provisioning profile doesn't support Associated Domains"

**Root Cause**:
- Xcode project had conflicting signing settings
- Automatic signing enabled BUT manual distribution identity also specified
- This prevented Xcode from auto-generating fresh provisioning profile

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed manual CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY[sdk=iphoneos*] line from Release configuration
- Kept only CODE_SIGN_STYLE = Automatic and DEVELOPMENT_TEAM

**Result**:
- Build 40 successfully archived
- IPA successfully exported for App Store distribution
- File: mobile/ios/build/ipa/divine.ipa
- Archive: ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2025-10-18/Runner-2025-10-18-180545.xcarchive

**Lesson**: When troubleshooting iOS signing, ALWAYS check for conflicting settings in project.pbxproj, not just the capabilities in Apple Developer Portal.
